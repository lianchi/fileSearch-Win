## Intro
- Hi, this is my first commit in Github where has too much to learn.
- These pieces of sh*t can search file by file name and file content in Windows platform. And I have to admit that these little scripts has sooooo many restrictions. 
- Note that you have to put them in the root directory of your USB flash before getting to work.
- The default directory you search is fixed to `C:\Users\Administrator\`, and the default keywords were `classified` and `confidential`. If you want to change, edit in the `.py` files.
- I assume that you have installed `Python2.7.*` :)

## HOW TO USE
1. Open the command line tool, change the directory to your USB flash root.

2. Input `python fileSearchByName.py` or `python fileSearchByContent.py`.

3. Now the script will search the files with specific keywords. When search is done, the files will be copied automatically to your USB flash root.
