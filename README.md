## Intro
- Hi, this is my first commit in Github where has too much to learn.
- This piece of sh*t can search file by filename in Windows platform. And I have to admit that this little script has sooooo many restrictions. 
- Note that you have to put it in the root directory of your USB flash before getting to work.
- The default directory you search is fixed to `C:\Users\Administrator\`, and the default keywords were `classified` and `confidential`. If you want to change, edit in the `fileSearchByName.py`.
- I assume that you have installed `Python2.7.*` :)

## HOW TO USE
1. Open the command line tool, change the directory to your USB flash root.

2. Input 
```
python fileSearchByName.py
```

3. Now the script will search the files with specific keywords. When search is done, the files will be copied automatically to your USB flash root.
